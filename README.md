# CyberSecurity Task 8 : VPN Hands-on Internship Project :

## i] Overview :
This repository contains documentation and evidence for the practical VPN task using Windscribe VPN on Windows. It demonstrates the setup, verification of IP change, encrypted browsing, and comparison of VPN ON vs OFF.

## ii] Contents :

- Screenshots showing real IP address before using VPN
- Screenshots showing VPN IP and new location after connecting
- Screenshot of encrypted browsing evidence (Google redirected to Hong Kong with HTTPS)
- Screenshot of IP and location after disconnecting VPN
- Summary report detailing the steps, VPN benefits, and limitations observed

## iii] How to Use :

1. Click on the above screenshots to view all image files documenting the task.
2. Read the "VPN Hands-on Report.txt" file for an overview of the VPN exercise and observations.
